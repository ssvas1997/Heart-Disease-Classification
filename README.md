## Classifying whether a patient has heart disease or not

I have used a standard Heart Disease UCI dataset. The classification is performed using KNN (7 Neighbors), SVM, Decision Tree and MLP.

Accuracy in % 
- K Nearest Neighbor (7 Neighbors) : 90.16%
- Support Vector Machines : 83.61%
- Decision Tree : 75.41%
- Multi Layer Perceptron : 85.25%
